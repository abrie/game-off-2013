![Product of a Disheveled Mind](screenshot.png)

A #ggo13 entry. This mess is what happens when a game is written without a clear mechanic. Constantly changing the development direction, searching for a game mechanic by hoping for serendipity. Various game objects and abandoned ideas are hidden behind a wall of commits. A pile of files as a trail to a constantly changing mind. [Play the game](http://abrie.github.io/game-off-2013/).

## The Game
This game was developed and tested with Chrome, please use it for best results. In this game you chase a Strawman around by solving [8-puzzles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). A solved 8-puzzle turns into a Jumphole through which you pass a Jingleball. The first puzzle you see has been solved for you as a model. Click the center hole and the Jingle ball begin a Jump Sequence. The Jingleball will Jangle after a number of Jumps. If the Jangle occurs in the same scene as the Strawman then you earn a point and the level advances with an additional scene. You can switch between scenes using the left/right arrows keys or A/D of WASD. Be warned that the Jump Sequence will be blocked if the destination puzzle is unsolved. That'll cost you a point. And you should know that the Jangleball fizzles out if it runs out of jumps. That'll also cost a point. [Play the game](http://abrie.github.io/game-off-2013/).

## The Hints
You can switch to an optional Probe Tool by pressing the 't' key. This tool will indicate to where a jumphole leads. Probing will neither earn nor cost points. If the probe doesn't enter the Jumphole then it means the Jump Destination puzzle is unsolved, so search for a likely candiate and solve it! Also note that you can displace the Strawman by shifting a tile of the puzzle he occupies.
